       <h2>Small History on Mary Louise Parther</h2>
       <p>Margarita Munoz / July 18th, 2023</p>
       <p>American spy Mary Louise Prather, who was born in 1913, was one of the first women to work in the field of cryptography. She performed the majority of her cryptography-related work during the beginning of the Cold War era and World War II. Prather had a wide range of positions at the Signal Intelligence Service (SIS).</p>
       <p>She started out as a junior clerical worker and moved up within the company to become the Chief of the Stenographic Division. Prather's early tasks consisted of operating office machinery including the sorter, reproducer, tabulator, and key punch. Prather was also in charge of categorizing intercepted messages, but this part of the work had to be done in absolute confidentiality. distributing the deciphered messages to the proper people was Prather's third task. Prather's biggest discovery and a crucial contribution to the war effort were made possible by working with the messages while they were still encoded and later on decoded.</p>
       <p>Prather won the Commendation for Meritorious Civilian Service award in 1969 after identifying a link between many coded Japanese messages. Her discovery eventually helped break the code the Japanese utilized to communicate encrypted messages during the war.</p>
