        Hi! My name is Margarita. I am 16 and going into my junior year, and I live and go to school in D.C ( the capital/best place in the US).  My whole family is from El Salvador so if you want pupusas let me know,  I live with my mother and little bother. I deiced to take this class because it seemed really interesting and want to learn more on how women are involved with tech. My plan is to double major in architecture and computer science and later become and architect. Outside of school I really like drawing and sleeping. My favorite TV shows are mostly K dramas and animes but I do like other shows. As for my music taste, I like The Weeknd, Lana Del Rey, Fujii Kaze and r&b.
